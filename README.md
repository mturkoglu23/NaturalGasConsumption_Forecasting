# Deep Learning Model Based on Heuristic Optimization for Natural Gas Consumption Forecasting
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of natural gas consumption plays a critical role in energy management and resource planning. Effective forecasting of energy demand enables balanced management of energy supply, while reducing costs and enabling the realisation of sustainable energy policies. In this study, a deep learning based model is developed to forecast natural gas consumption. The proposed model performs the prediction process by extracting meaningful features from the data through convolutional and dense layers. In order to maximise the performance of the model, challenges such as determining the number of layers are solved using a heuristic algorithm, Tree Structured Parzen (TPE) optimisation. This optimisation process allowed the structural and training parameters of the model to be automatically optimised, resulting in more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed model offers much higher accuracy and performance compared to conventional methods. In particular, the accurate capture of seasonal variations and sudden demand fluctuations demonstrates the success of the model in the field of energy management and natural gas demand forecasting. The study also reveals that combining deep learning techniques with heuristic optimisation algorithms offers a significant innovation for natural gas consumption forecasting. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied not only in natural gas forecasting models but also in other complex time series problems.
